#Machine Learning Algorithms

I know there are whole suites of libraries (Caffe, TensorFlow) out there for
these algorithms already but I thought it would be a fun side hobby to learn
and implement them myself

**This is purely educational for me.** I don't really expect anyone else to use
these algorithms. Don't expect any warranty. :D
